    <p>This is an Etali, (his friends called him Steve) a long forgotten evolution of dinosaur.  Due to his strange leg anatomy, it is often speculated that the Etali species is a distant relative of the giraffe.  Regardless, Steve is capable of jumping extremely high, running extremely fast, and being absolutely, <em>unabashedly</em>, the coolest dino-man a person could have the pleasure of meeting.  Careful though, his long legs make him quite clumsy so he is prone to falling over.   </p>
